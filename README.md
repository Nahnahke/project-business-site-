Project Business Site - https://fluffy-kitsune-4c750d.netlify.app/

🏁 Goals:

In this project we as a group were tasked to create a simple business site with a hero image or video, a signup form and an accordion. Our stretch goal was to use a hero video for this project and we managed to do all we set out to do. 

We started building the project in a Figma file, designing the page and deciding on the different features. After this we utilized mob-programming and built the site together in a couple of hours. 

For this being one of our first projects we ever made, I think it turned out quite well. It was fun working as a team and collaborating on the project together. 

We are very pleased with the outcome and looking forward to using the skills and knowledge we gained from this project in future endeavors.

Must-have requirements:

✅ Hero Image/Video.

✅ Signup Form.

✅ Accordion.

🚧 The problem:

We started by going through the design and sketching the different components out along with the design, deciding on how to structure the webpage. We used a mob-programming approach, starting off with the hero video and then moving along to the signup form.

If we had more time, we would have worked on the design.
